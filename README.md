# Happy Proxy ❤️❤️❤️

## Overview

A proxy to bring out the best in the internet

## Running

Clone the repo, run `yarn && yarn start` to start up the proxy.

You'll need to import the root cert (trust me, it's fine, I'm totally not hacking your IP right now).

Set up the HTTP and HTTPS proxies in any browser to point to `http://localhost:8001`, and let the new, improved internet fill your heart with joy.
